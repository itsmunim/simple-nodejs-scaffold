/**
 * @module {{resource.name}} model
 *
 * @description
 * Depending on which ORM you use(e.g. mongoose, Joi, TypeORM etc.)
 * you should define the model for your resource here. If you need
 * multiple models for your api, consider defining a `models` folder
 * and putting all the model files inside with respective names.
 *
 * Example-
 * For an order management API the models folder might look like below-
 *
 * models
 *  - order.item.js
 *  - order.js
